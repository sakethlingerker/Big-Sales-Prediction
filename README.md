# Big Sales Prediction

This project focuses on predicting big sales using the **Random Forest Regressor** model. The aim is to build an accurate and robust machine learning model that can forecast sales based on historical data and various features such as store size, location, and promotional activities.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Features and Data Preprocessing**
- **Handling Missing Values**: Impute or remove missing data to ensure a complete dataset.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical data into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Scaling Features**: Normalize or standardize features to improve model performance and convergence.

### 2. **Model Training**
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor
  - Ensemble-based algorithm for robust and accurate predictions.
  - Handles non-linear relationships and provides feature importance insights.
- Train the model on the processed dataset to capture patterns in sales based on the provided features.

### 3. **Model Evaluation**
Evaluate the model performance using:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Penalizes larger errors more than MAE, providing a comprehensive evaluation of prediction accuracy.

### 4. **Visualization**
- Plot **feature importances** to identify key drivers of sales.
- Visualize **sales predictions** versus actual sales to assess model behavior and accuracy.
